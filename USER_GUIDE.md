# Family Timeline - User Guide

## Introduction
Family Timeline was originally conceived as a tool to help date old family photographs. When examining vintage photos, we often find ourselves asking questions like "How old would grandmother have been in this picture?" or "Was this before or after the wedding?" This application was designed to answer these questions and many more by providing a comprehensive timeline of family events and relationships.
