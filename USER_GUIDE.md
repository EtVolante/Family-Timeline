# Family Timeline - User Guide

## Introduction
Family Timeline was originally conceived as a tool to help date old family photographs. When examining vintage photos, we often find ourselves asking questions like "How old would grandmother have been in this picture?" or "Was this before or after the wedding?" This application was designed to answer these questions and many more by providing a comprehensive timeline of family events and relationships.

## Project Goals and Solutions

### Photo Dating and Family History
- **Goal**: Determine the approximate date of old photographs based on the apparent ages of people in them
- **Solution**: Use the date filter to explore different time periods and see the ages of all family members at that point

### Age and Event Analysis
1. **Temporal Questions**
   - Find how old people were on any specific date
   - Calculate marriage durations at any point in time
   - Discover what life events intersected with a particular date

2. **Relationship Analysis**
   - Compare relative ages between family members
   - Determine who was alive during specific periods
   - Understand generational overlaps
   - Calculate ages at important life events (marriages, births, etc.)

3. **Planning and Celebration**
   - Track upcoming birthdays and anniversaries
   - Plan future family events with age awareness
